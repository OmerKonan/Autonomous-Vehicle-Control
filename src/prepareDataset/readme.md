### get_sensor_data.py  

This is a little exercise for study with Carla sensors. To learn how to add different sensors, how to get sensor data and how to show and save these images. 

This program shows the RGB camera, depth camera and semantig segmentation camera images when the car move around. Saving these images is possible with -i parameter. 

### rgb_and_seg.py  

This is a [Carla manual control code](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/master/PythonAPI/examples/manual_control.py) with little changes.  

This program has an improved information panel. After execution RGB images will be in _out folder and the corresponding semantig segmentation images will be in _seg folder.  


### mask_road.py  

This is a program for masking the road pixel from semantic segmentation images. This program marks the road pixels from given images in _seg directiory and then save the new images in mask folder.  

### rgb_and_steering.py 

This is a manual control code with little changes. Program saves the RGB images and corresponding steering angle. After execution RGB images will be in _out folder and steering angles in data.txt.  

### process_steering.py 

This file has a different functions for organizing steering angles dataset. All functions have a little comment about what they do.
